# Tree_Fork
In this project, the tree height will be given as a command line argument. According to the incoming argument, files with txt extension will be created for each node in the structure to be created. The filenames will be determined by the pid the nodes have. Random values ​​for leaf nodes will be generated and stored in the files created. Starting from the leaves, while going up, the values ​​in the child nodes will be collected and transferred to the parent node. There is also a makefile in the project. This project was written for System Programming lecture.
